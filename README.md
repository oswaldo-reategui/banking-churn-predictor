# Customer Attrition Analysis and Prediction in Banking Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Introduction
This repository contains my final coursework for an Applied Machine Learning course as part of my MSc. The project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer attrition in the banking sector using various machine learning models. This is a crucial business problem since retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. 

## Project Overview
In this project, we:
- Analyze customer data from a bank to understand factors contributing to customer churn.
- Develop and compare multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, to predict customer attrition.
- Apply techniques like SMOTE for handling class imbalance and Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.

## Key Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating models
- Imbalanced-learn for handling imbalanced data

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed with the required libraries. You can install the dependencies using:
`
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
`

## Highlights of the Analysis
- **Data Exploration**: Insights into demographics, behavior, and financial features of the bank's customers.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representations to understand the distribution and relationships of various features.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluation of different models to identify the most effective predictor of customer churn.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Implementation of SMOTE for class balancing and Grid Search for finding optimal model parameters.

## Usage
To explore the analysis, run the Jupyter notebook:
`
jupyter notebook banking_churn_predictor.ipynb
`

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to tackling customer attrition in banking. The Gradient Boosting Machine model, after rigorous tuning and balancing, proved to be the most effective, achieving high accuracy and recall. These insights can guide strategic decisions for customer retention in the banking industry.
